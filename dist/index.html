        Hey... I'm CJ! But you can call me CJ... I'm usually kept to myself, I'm really shy... I don't want the other girls to know that... that I'm not like the other girls... that I'm actually a werewolf fairy princess with demon powers I gained from my werewolf fairy princess father and demon mother... I sometimes can't keep these powers to myself... but I have to learn how to control them in order to save the world! So yeah, that's me!
