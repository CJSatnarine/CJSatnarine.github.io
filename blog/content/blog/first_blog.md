This is the first blog post I have made here, or any where for that matter. I am terrible at web development, and I reckon that if it wasn't for the help of some amazing, experienced people, I wouldn't have made it this far.    

## In the beginning...
This website project started as a plain, unstyled HTML file that had many changes.
