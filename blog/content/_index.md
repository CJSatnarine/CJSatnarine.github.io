Hey... I'm CJ! But you can call me CJ... As you can tell, this website is currently under construction. I'll be updating it slowly as I learn more web development. I'm remaking this website with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) because I want to write blogs and devlogs in the future.

Any way, I'm an aspriring graphics programmer from Waterloo, Ontario. I've got a few weird interests in linguistics, history, maths, 3D animation, game development, and art.
Currently, I'm spending a lot of my time learning a lot of things relating to my interests. You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/CJSatnarine" target="_blank">Github</a> to see what I'm up to.

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    } 
}
```
