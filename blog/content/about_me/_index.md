I'm a 20 year old Software Engineering drop out from Kitchener, Ontario. I spend most of my day just learning things relating to my interests.

The phrase ***Vaxandi Forritari*** is Icelandic for ***learning programmer***. I loved programming since I was 16, discovering my love for it in highschool when learning to make a game. I'm familiar with the following programming languages:
- *C#*#: learnt it in 2021 for scripting in Unity
- *Java*: learnt it in Computer Science class in highschool, spent most of my time in Grades 11 and 12 using Java
- *Processing*: used it for making graphics in Media Arts class in highschool
- *Python*: learnt it for scripting with the [Blender Python API](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html)
- *Arduino*: this is C but I learnt this before learning C/C++, used it in Computer Engineering classes in highschool
- *C/C++*: used a bit of it for programming [Mirobo UBMP4s](https://mirobo.tech/ubmp4) in high school Computer Engineering classes, learnt way more in college when persuing software engineering
- *6808 Assembly*: learnt it in college and I never want to touch it again
- *HTML, CSS*: learnt it to make this website
- *JavaScript*: learnt it to script in Three.js

My interest in graphics rose after realising that I didn't like software engineering, but instead with graphics and programming. I am currently learning OpenGL with C++, as well as learning GLSL for computer shading. I hope to work in Vulkan in the future.

I'm really into languages. Since I was kid, I have loved learning about other cultures and traditions, including their languages. For a while, I was grinding Duolingo, but that felt more of a game than actually learning, so I stopped that and tried learning languages through other means. My native tongue is English, but I am interested in so many languages: 
- *Deutsch*: currently learning Hochdeutsch by myself, learning Schwiizerdütsch from my Swiss friends
- *Español*: learnt some Spanish when I was younger, not really good at it but I can barely hold a conversation
- *Français*: learnt a bit in school, but my French is really bad as I often confuse Parisian French with Swiss French
- *Nederlands*: learnt some when I was younger, I'm not as good as I used to be
- *Dansk*: I had to pretend to be Danish for a year (it's just like how it sounds...)
- *Íslenska*: I know this cool Icelandic guy and the language is so cool like omg what do you mean you told Denmark to piss off
- *Norsk*: Norwegian is interesting but I already know some Danish and I'm not sure if I want to learn Danish cloned
- *lingua latina*: learnt a bit in school, pretty cool language
- *ελληνικά*: Greek is kinda cool, I wanna learn it in the future
- *Русский*: I have no intention of learning Russian but a friend said I should learn Russian just to read Tolstoy's War and Peace in the original Russian
- *Suomi*: my brother is learning Finnish so I might learn it as well for the funnies
- *davvisámegiella*: I discovered Northern Sámi through music, and I think it's a cool language
- *kalaallisut*: Greenlandic was also discovered through my music, I think it's also cool 

Unfortunately, I do not think I'll be able to learn all of these languages. That's fine, I'm happy about learning as much as I can.

As mentioned, my interest in programming came with my introduction to game development.
