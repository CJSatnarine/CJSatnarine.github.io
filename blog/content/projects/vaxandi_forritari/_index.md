Vaxandi forritari means *growing developer/programmer* in Icelandic. I'm still learning a lot, so I'm a *vaxandi forritari* in a way.  This is a place where you'll find my coding projects, tech projects, anything that's coding but not <a id="aspiring_graphics_programmer" href="/projects/aspiring_graphics_programmer/">graphics programming</a> or <a id="wannabe_game_developer" href="/projects/wannabe_game_developer/">game development</a>.

###### Projects coming soon!
