    First blog post: Website Stuff
</h1>

<h3 id="subtitle" class="subtitle"><strong>[CJ Satnarine] | 2025-03-21 </strong></h3>
<p>This is the first blog post I have made here, or any where for that matter. The entire purpose of this blog was to test out how it would be to write one.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning...</h2>
<p>This website project started as a plain, unstyled HTML file that had a couple of changes occasionally.

<h2 id="the-head">The Head</h2>
<p>The idea for the head came from a project I was working on (a <a href="https://github.com/CJSatnarine/tiny_renderer">tiny renderer</a>), where a wireframe render inspired me to add a rotating wireframe furry wolf head to my personal website.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, I created a wolf head in Blender and exported it in a Wavefront .obj format. I used <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> to render the wolf head on the website. This version of the website is where I also started using CSS.</p>
<p>I should note that this was the first time I was working with JavaScript and CSS, and if it wasn't for some amazing people guiding me and answering my questions, I would have probably not made it this far. To deploy this website, I used Vite.</p>
<h2 id="zola">Zola</h2>
<p>I love using markdown. I prefer it over most other markup languages, and I write most of my notes in it. When I found out I could use markdown for web dev, I started to replace my previous website design to use Zola (mostly so I can get help from a friend that uses/recommended it). This took me about a week to do, somehow.</p>
<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<p>I plan on uploading more work onto here: projects, devlogs, art or animations, and more blogs.</p>
