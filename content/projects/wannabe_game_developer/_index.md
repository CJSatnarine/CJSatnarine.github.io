Here you'll find my game dev projects. I have had an interest in game development for as long as I have been learning to program. Throughout my time programming, I have used (and plan to use) a couple of game engines: 
- *Unity*: this was where I learnt how to program in C#, and where most of my experience lies in terms of game engines (picked it up in 2021)
- *Godot*: learning Godot because I love FOSS, I use C# instead of GDScript for scripting (picked it up in 2025)
- *UPBGE*: tried out [Blender's game engine](https://upbge.org/#/) for a few months but I wasn't a fan of scripting in Python so I ditched it 
- *GDevelop*: yeah no
- *LÃ–VE*: tried it out but it was more of a playground than using it as an actual game engine
- *Pygame*: did a bit in highschool, but that's about it
- *Kyzen*: soon to be first beta tester of [Kyzen 2D game engine](https://github.com/luut189/kyzen)

I am currently trying to focus on using Unity.
