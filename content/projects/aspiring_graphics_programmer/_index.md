I think graphics are cool. I really like graphics. When I grow up I want to be a graphics programmer. For now I can pretend I'm one while learning a few things. Here you'll find those learning projects.  

My admiration for computer graphics grew with my interests in programming and 3D animation. Since July of 2024, I have been trying teaching myself graphics programming (it's difficult but I love it). Currently, I am teaching myself *OpenGL* and *GLSL*. Eventually, I hope to move onto something modern like *Vulkan* once I'm more experienced. I also hope to experiment more with *Godot Shader Language* in Godot.
