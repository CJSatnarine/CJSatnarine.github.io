I want to start making more animations and art. This is where I show my animations and artwork. I fell in love with *Blender* while learning to programme at age 16. My introduction came from Media Arts class, where I initially learnt Blender for making assets for Unity. I fell in love with creating models and experimenting with shaders. The following two years of high school were spent developing my skills in the software. After graduating highschool, I stopped using the software to focus on software engineering for college for about two years. Now I hope to revisit this old passion of mine, and also venture into the unknown territory of digital art with *Krita*.
