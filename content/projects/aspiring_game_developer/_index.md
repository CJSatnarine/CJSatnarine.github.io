I think graphics are cool. I really like graphics. When I grow up I want to be a graphics programmer. For now I can learn how to be a game developer while playing around with graphics stuff. Here you'll find those learning projects. 

My admiration for computer graphics and game development grew with my interests in programming and 3D animation. Throughout the years, I have used (and plan to use) a couple of game engines: 
- *Unity*: this was where I learnt how to program in C#, and where most of my experience lies in terms of game engines (picked it up in 2021)
- *Godot*: learning Godot because I love FOSS, I use C# instead of GDScript for scripting (picked it up in 2025)
- *UPBGE*: tried out [Blender's game engine](https://upbge.org/#/) for a few months but I wasn't a fan of scripting in Python so I ditched it 
- *GDevelop*: yeah no
- *LÃ–VE*: tried it out but it was more of a playground than using it as an actual game engine
- *Pygame*: did a bit in highschool, but that's about it
- *Kyzen*: soon to be first beta tester of [Kyzen 2D game engine](https://github.com/luut189/kyzen)

Since July of 2024, I have been trying teaching myself graphics programming (it's difficult but I love it). Currently, I am teaching myself *OpenGL* and *GLSL*. Eventually, I hope to move onto something modern like *Vulkan* once I'm more experienced. I also hope to experiment more with *Godot Shader Language* in Godot. I am currently using *Godot* for my game development projects.
