Languages are cool. I like languages. I want to languages. Here you will find my linguistics projects.

As a young child, I have had an interest in linguistics. For a while, I was grinding Duolingo, but that felt more of a game than actually learning, so I stopped that and tried learning languages through other means. My native tongue is *English*, but I find interest in these other languages: 
- *Deutsch*: currently learning both Hochdeutsch and Schwiizerdütsch from my Swiss friends
- *Español*: learnt some Spanish when I was younger, not really good at it but I can barely hold a conversation
- *Français*: learnt a bit in school, but my French is really bad as I often confuse Parisian French with Swiss French
- *Nederlands*: learnt some when I was younger, I'm not as good as I used to be
- *Dansk*: an unfortunate event occured
- *Íslenska*: I know this cool Icelandic guy and the language is so cool because they still use þorn
- *Norsk*: Norwegian is interesting but I already know some Danish and I'm not sure if I want to learn Danish but less funny-sounding
- *Lingua Latina*: learnt a bit in school, pretty cool language
- *ελληνικά*: Greek is kinda cool, I wanna learn it in the future
- *Русский*: I have no interest in learning Russian but I am going to torture myself by learning Russian just to read Tolstoy's War and Peace its original language
- *Suomi*: my brother is learning Finnish so I might learn it as well for the funnies
- *Davvisámegiella*: I discovered Northern Sámi through music, and I think it's a cool language
- *Kalaallisut*: Greenlandic was also discovered through music, I think it's also cool 

Unfortunately, I do not think I'll be able to learn all of these languages. That's fine, I'm happy about learning as much as I can.
