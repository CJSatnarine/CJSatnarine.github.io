This is where you'll find my coding projects, tech projects, anything that's coding but isn't <a id="aspiring_graphics_programmer" href="/projects/aspiring_graphics_programmer/">graphics programming</a> or <a id="wannabe_game_developer" href="/projects/wannabe_game_developer/">game development</a>.

The phrase ***Vaxandi Forritari*** is Icelandic for ***learning programmer***. I'm still learning a lot, so I'm a *vaxandi forritari* in a way. I discovered my love for programming in highschool at the age of 16, when I was learning to use the Unity game engine. I'm familiar with the following programming languages:
- *C#*: learnt it in 2021 for scripting in Unity
- *Java*: learnt it in Computer Science class in highschool, spent most of my time in Grades 11 and 12 using Java
- *Processing*: used it for making graphics in Media Arts class in highschool
- *Python*: learnt it for scripting with the [Blender Python API](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html), later used it to try out Pygame and [Blender's game engine](https://upbge.org/#/)
- *Arduino*: this is C but I learnt this before learning C/C++, used it in Computer Engineering classes in highschool
- *C/C++*: used a bit of it for programming [Mirobo UBMP4s](https://mirobo.tech/ubmp4) in high school Computer Engineering classes, learnt way more in college when persuing software engineering
- *6808 Assembly*: learnt it in college and I never want to touch it again
- *HTML, CSS*: learnt it to make this website
- *JavaScript*: learnt it to script in Three.js
- *Lua*: used to configure Neovim, used a bit with LÃ–VE
- *GDScript*: learning it to use with the Godot game engine
