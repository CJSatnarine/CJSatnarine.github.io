I have created this website as my portfolio. However, there is a reason why I haven't showed anything in my portfolio. I am scared of some company taking my works and using it to train their generative AIs. It isn't fair. But it's a strange fear. Sometimes I don't care about them and I just create things for the sake of creating them, for the love of the craft. With that mind set, I'll just keep creating the things I'm passionate about, and keep posting them on this website. 

I stopped using Instagram because, to me, it's hell. I don't want to use Instagram, or Pinterest, or even YouTube any more because they don't care about us creators. So, if I were to leave these platforms, what choices do I have? I have this website for my portfolio, of course. But I wouldn't be seen by other people. I don't know if I want to be seen or not, but a portfolio is, well, a display of my work. I didn't start creating just to show other people my work, I created for the sake of creating. Other than this website, there's Artstation. I never posted there before, but maybe when I get better I'll post there. I am **NOT** going to post my work on LinkedIn. I absolutely hate that platform. Everyone seems there seems so fake. Perhaps I hate the professional, corporate culture there. 

Maybe I don't want to share my work on the major platforms. That's a selfish thought, isn't it? Yes, no one is going to see my work. It will be kept all to myself. But that isn't me. I want to share to inspire others to create, as others have inspired me to create. I want to help others learn, and I want to see the amazing things they create. My happiness comes from others discovering and expressing their passions. I'm constantly struggling with myself, fighting between the urge to isolate myself from everything (online and in person) and the urge to spend more time with people. I can't seem to find a balance. 

I don't know why I'm sharing this here. I don't know a lot of things. But what I do know is that this is *my* website. I've been told that it wasn't professional enough. I don't care. I can share whatever I wish on this website. So I'll share this bit of me with you. After writing all of that, I have decided to post my works here. The companies will keep stealing work, there's not doubt about that, but I'll keep creating and sharing. Thank you for reading this little rant of mine. Sorry for wasting your time, it could have been spent doing something productive. 

Tschau.
