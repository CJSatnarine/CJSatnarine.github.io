Hey, I'm CJ! I'm a 20 year old from Kitchener, Ontario with dreams of being a graphics programmer/technical artist/game developer. I attended Software Engineering Technology at Conestoga College between September 2023 and August 2024. Turned out software engineering wasn't my cup of tea, so I dropped out. Nowadays I'm just working on projects and trying to teach myself a few things.  

I do not use generative AI in any of my work. At this moment, I do not plan on using generative AI because I do not need it. My goal is to learn, not to be productive and fast; AI is a tool that I'll prefer not to use for my projects. 

I try to use mainly free and open source softwares (FOSS) for my projects.
