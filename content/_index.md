Hey, I'm CJ! I'm an aspiring graphics programmer/technical artist/game developer from Waterloo or Kitchener or somewhere in that area it's basically the same city. I like coding and animating and languages and computers and reading and music. i use arch btw but I'm not that lost yet I still (occasionally) go outside!! I'm not like the other programmers I swear... I've been avoiding caffeine since 2022...

Any way, I attended Software Engineering Technology at Conestoga College between September 2023 and August 2024. Turned out software engineering wasn't my cup of tea, so I dropped out. Nowadays I'm just working on projects, volunteering at a [computer recycling centre](https://www.theworkingcentre.org/projects/computer-recycling/), and trying to teach myself a few things.

> I do not use generative AI in any of my work. At this moment, I do not plan on using generative AI because I do not need it: my goal is to learn, not to just get things done.
