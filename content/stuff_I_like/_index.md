## Music
This is in no way all of my favourite artists, there are too many to list. These are just the ones I really enjoy and don't mind sharing: 
- *Molchat Doma* 
- *LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER*
- *FIBEL*: I really like their songs Winter and Unique.
- *HARBOUR*
- *Provinz*: I just listened to them a lot when I was learning German.
- *DOUBLECAMP*
- *Emil Kárlsen*: I really enjoyed his song Muohta and the album Nagirvárrái. His music was my introduction to the Northern Sámi language. 
- *Dorian Concept*
- *tomcbumpz*
- *Pogo*
- *Home*
- *Nanook*: I really like their song Ingerlaliinnaleqaagut. It was my introduction to the Greenlandic language.
