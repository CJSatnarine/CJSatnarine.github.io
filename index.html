    <h1> Hello, I'm CJ! </h1>
    <p> I apologise for the disappointing website. I guess I'll work on it eventually, add some CSS or whatever. Or not. Who are you to judge? Any way, I'm just a guy trying to learn a thing or two. </p>

    <p> You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/CJSatnarine"> GitHub </a> but don't expect anything amazing. I have "vaxandi forritari" in my profile about me. Vaxandi forritari is
        <a href="https://iceland.nordicvisitor.com/travel-guide/information/icelandic-language/">Icelandic </a> 
        for "learning programmer". I asked my Icelandic friend to translate that for me. My about me used to be "hræðilegur forritari", which means terrible programmer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language"> Icelandic </a>. I am not Icelandic. </p>

    <p> I read someone else's portfolio website and they talked about themself. I should probably do that. You probably already read my interests on my GitHub README. Not really a fun guy because I don't game or watch shows like my peers. I never had gipfeli in my life. I attemped to go to college for software engineering but realised I hated writing boring ass applications and dropped out after some mental breakdowns. I like graphics. I also like linguistics. My IDE is telling me the last three sentences began with the same word, and is advising me to use a thesaurus. I haven't used caffeine since November of 2022. I tend to make things hard for myself. I overcomplicate things. i use arch btw. I often ask myself "vart ska jag?" because I have no clue where I'm heading. </p>

    <p> Eventually I'll make this more serious or professional or whatever. I'll put up a place for the games I make and another place for the stuff I make in Blender. I'll add a blog for random shit I learnt. Contact information is on the GitHub README. </p>
