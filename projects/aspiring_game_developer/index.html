    Aspiring Game Developer
</h1>

<p>I think graphics are cool. I really like graphics. When I grow up I want to be a graphics programmer. For now I can learn how to be a game developer while playing around with graphics stuff. Here you'll find those learning projects.</p>
<p>My admiration for computer graphics and game development grew with my interests in programming and 3D animation. Throughout the years, I have used (and plan to use) a couple of game engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unity</em>: this was where I learnt how to program in C#, and where most of my experience lies in terms of game engines (picked it up in 2021)</li>
<li><em>Godot</em>: learning Godot because I love FOSS, I use C# instead of GDScript for scripting (picked it up in 2025)</li>
<li><em>UPBGE</em>: tried out <a href="https://upbge.org/#/">Blender's game engine</a> for a few months but I wasn't a fan of scripting in Python so I ditched it</li>
<li><em>GDevelop</em>: yeah no</li>
<li><em>LÃ–VE</em>: tried it out but it was more of a playground than using it as an actual game engine</li>
<li><em>Pygame</em>: did a bit in highschool, but that's about it</li>
<li><em>Kyzen</em>: soon to be first beta tester of <a href="https://github.com/luut189/kyzen">Kyzen 2D game engine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since July of 2024, I have been trying teaching myself graphics programming (it's difficult but I love it). Currently, I am teaching myself <em>OpenGL</em> and <em>GLSL</em>. Eventually, I hope to move onto something modern like <em>Vulkan</em> once I'm more experienced. I also hope to experiment more with <em>Godot Shader Language</em> in Godot. I am currently using <em>Godot</em> for my game development projects.</p>
