    Amateur Linguist
</h1>

<p>Languages are cool. I like languages. I want to languages. Here you will find my linguistics projects.</p>
<p>As a young child, I have had an interest in linguistics. For a while, I was grinding Duolingo, but that felt more of a game than actually learning, so I stopped that and tried learning languages through other means. My native tongue is <em>English</em>, but I find interest in these other languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Deutsch</em>: currently learning both Hochdeutsch and Schwiizerdütsch from my Swiss friends</li>
<li><em>Español</em>: learnt some Spanish when I was younger, not really good at it but I can barely hold a conversation</li>
<li><em>Français</em>: learnt a bit in school, but my French is really bad as I often confuse Parisian French with Swiss French</li>
<li><em>Nederlands</em>: learnt some when I was younger, I'm not as good as I used to be</li>
<li><em>Dansk</em>: an unfortunate event occured</li>
<li><em>Íslenska</em>: I know this cool Icelandic guy and the language is so cool because they still use þorn</li>
<li><em>Norsk</em>: Norwegian is interesting but I already know some Danish and I'm not sure if I want to learn Danish but less funny-sounding</li>
<li><em>Lingua Latina</em>: learnt a bit in school, pretty cool language</li>
<li><em>ελληνικά</em>: Greek is kinda cool, I wanna learn it in the future</li>
<li><em>Русский</em>: I have no interest in learning Russian but I am going to torture myself by learning Russian just to read Tolstoy's War and Peace its original language</li>
<li><em>Suomi</em>: my brother is learning Finnish so I might learn it as well for the funnies</li>
<li><em>Davvisámegiella</em>: I discovered Northern Sámi through music, and I think it's a cool language</li>
<li><em>Kalaallisut</em>: Greenlandic was also discovered through music, I think it's also cool</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not think I'll be able to learn all of these languages. That's fine, I'm happy about learning as much as I can.</p>
